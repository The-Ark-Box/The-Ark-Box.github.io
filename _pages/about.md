Hi! I'm Dillon Bowes, a driven and dedicated individual with a strong foundation in economics and data science, currently studying at UCSD with a recent quarter GPA of 3.45. My technical expertise includes statistical software, data visualization, and machine learning, and I am proficient in Excel, PowerPoint, and various collaboration tools.

A little bit about me and my work experience:
During my internship at NIWC PAC, I honed my skills in data analysis and economic modeling while managing workflow and deliverables in a fast-paced business environment. I led a project on robotics, gathering and analyzing data through Inventor CAD. At WELK Resorts, I thrived in a technical and mechanical role, swiftly addressing issues and improving company efficiency. My contributions were recognized multiple times, up to the Vice-President level.

I actively volunteer at Rady’s Children’s Hospital and the San Diego Food Bank, giving back to the community and gaining valuable leadership skills. I also mentored incoming freshmen at UCSD, guiding them in academic and professional development.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am passionate about music, playing guitar and piano, and DJing and producing music. I enjoy skateboarding, surfing, and video editing, maintaining a well-rounded work-life balance. My diverse interests and experiences reflect my ability to manage projects, work creatively, and pursue continuous growth.
